        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          At Rails Template App, we strive to provide the best service possible. We understand that sometimes
          things don't work out as planned. This Refund Policy explains our policies regarding refunds for
          subscription payments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">2. Subscription Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          We offer a <strong>7-day money-back guarantee</strong> for all new subscriptions. If you are not satisfied
          with our service within the first 7 days of your initial subscription, you may request a full refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the initial 7-day period, subscription payments are non-refundable. However, you may cancel your
          subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the service until the end of your current billing cycle.
